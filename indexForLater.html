<!-- This is the html code I made for the author webpage before realizing that with only one book it didn't make sense to have a webpage. It now redirects to the
homepage, but one day when I write more I plan to replace the author section on the homepage with buttons to lead here, and the author section content on the
homepage would now be located here. Then, the author href in the heading on the homepage would lead here. -->
